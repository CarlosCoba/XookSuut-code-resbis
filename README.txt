Installation

(1) Make a directory to put the executables in:
mkdir ~/XS-code

(2) copy all files in this new folder

(3) Make the file executable:
chmod +x XookSuut-res.py

(4) Edit  .bashrc:
gedit ~/.bashrc

Add the folowing line. In case you put the code in the home directory, this would be:
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/XS-code"

Refresh the bash file:
source ~/.bashrc

Try it. Go to any folder and type  XookSuut-res.py

you must get the following :

INPUT:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
parameter|	default value	|	Description 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
object =	- 		Object name.
vel_map = 	-		FITS file containing the 2D velocity map in km/s.
evel_map = 	-		FITS file containing the 2D error map in km/s. If no error map is passed then set this to "".
SN = 		-		S/N cut applied on the velocity map. Pixels in the error map above this value are masked.
				if evel_map is set to 0, then the whole velocity map will be used for estimating the rotation curve.
VSYS	=	""		Guess value for Vsys. If VSYS is set to "", then it will be used the central value as guess (i.e., VSYS =  vel_map[Y0][X0]).
PA	= 	-		Guess value for the position angle of the major axis.		
INC	=	-		Guess value for the inclination.
X0,Y0	=	-		Guess values for the kinematic center. These are in pixel coordinates. 
N_it 	=	5		Number of iteratios to find the best parameters. 
pixel_scale	1		Size of the pixel in arcsecs.
vary_PA =	1		Boolean.
vary_INC =	1		Boolean.
vary_XC =	1		Boolean.
vary_YC =	1		Boolean.
vary_VSYS =	1		Boolean.
vary_PHI_BAR =	1		Boolean. Position angle of the bisimetric distortion on the galaxy plane.
delta =		""		Width of the rings (2*delta) in the tabulated model. If delta is set to "", then delta = 0.5*ring_space
ring_space =	2.5		Spacing between rings used to create the interpolated model. 
rstart	=	2.5		Initial radius in the interpolated model. 
rfinal	=	40		Final radius in the interpolated model.
frac_pixel = 	2/3.		Fraction of total pixels within a ring required to compute the tabulated model. If frac_pixel = 1, 
				then 100% of the pixels within a ring are required to be filled with data to compute the tabulated model.

r_bar_min,max= 	2.5,40		Maximum and minimum length of the bisymmetric perturbation. If only a value is passed then it'll be considered as r_bar_max.
model	= 	circular	The different kinematic models. You must choose between: "circular" motion (circular), "radial" flows (radial), "bisymmetric" 					(oval distortion), "twostep" (forces circular + bisymmetric) and "resbis" (create a bisymmetric model with a residual map).
				This new version allows fitting a bisymmetric model to the residuals from the circular model. This is the "resbis" mode. 
				is the residual map. In addtion it is included the "twostep" mode. This mode forces a "circular" mode + "bisymmetric" mode during the fitting. 
errors	=	1		Boolean. If you want to compute errors on the derived parameters via Metropolis-Hastings analysis. Otherwise it will use the chi-square analysis (faster).
survey =	-		String. If the object belongs to a specific galaxy survey put it here.
config =	""		configure file to pass initial guess and constrains for the constant params (x0, y0, Vsys, pa, inc, phi_bar). This file is optional.
				If this file is passed to XookSuut, then it will ommit the previos guess values (VSYS, PA, INC, X0, Y0) as well as the VARY_ entrance. This only affects the chi--square 					analysis not the Metropolis-Hastings analysis.
save_plots =			Boolean
e_ISM =		5		Error in the emission line centroid.
steps =		1e4		Steps for the Metropolis-Hastings analysis.
method =	Powell		Minimization method used in the chi--square analysis, options are "Powel" or "leastsq". Powell is much slower than "leastsq"
use_mh =	1		Choose if you want to use the Metropolis-Hastings analysis to derive the best fit values. Otherwise it will use the outputs from the chi--square analysis.
prefix = 	--		Prefix to pass to the object's name.


A configuration file has the follow entrance

#
#
# XS config file
# Example of configuration file
# param col. are the constant parameters to fit. Do not touch this column.
# val col. corresponds to the initial values for the considered parameters
# fit col. is a boolen. If set to 1 means the parameter is fitted, other wise set 0.
# min col. is the minimum value for the considered parameter. If fit is seto to 0, the min value is not taken into account. 
# max col. is the maximum value for the considered parameter. If fit is seto to 0, the max value is not taken into account.
